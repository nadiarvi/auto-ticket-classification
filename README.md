# Automatic Customer Ticket Classification

This is the repository for Team 3 for CS372 Natural Language Processing with Python in KAIST.

## Introduction

This project introduces an automated ticket classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python's NLTK library. The goal is to streamline customer service by automatically categorizing support tickets into specific classes such as 'Issue', 'Refund', and 'Feedback'. This approach aims to improve response times and overall efficiency by identifying the main topic, recognizing the product referenced, suggesting a response type, and generating a concise summary of the complaint. The system's automation could potentially lead to quicker issue resolution, reducing the need for extensive human intervention and enhancing overall customer satisfaction.
